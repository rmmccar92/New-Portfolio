# Portfolio 2

For this project we were asked to update our portfolio with various links and resources that displayed our work to date. While remaking the portfolio was not a requirement I wanted to refresh myself on some HTML and CSS techniques and I wasn't too happy with how my first portfolio turned out. While I still think I have a long way to go in terms of web design I think I have at least produced a better product than my other attempt. As this is a portfolio the plan is to routinely come back to it and slowly update it as I progress. 

# Technologies Used

-Adobe XD
I had been hearing about this program for a while and wanted to use it as I was already familiar with other Adobe products and I think it is a great way to layout your site if you have access to it. An image of my initial design layout can be seen below.
