# Portfolio 2

For this project we were asked to update our portfolio with various links and resources that displayed our work to date. While remaking the portfolio was not a requirement I wanted to refresh myself on some HTML and CSS techniques and I wasn't too happy with how my first portfolio turned out. While I still think I have a long way to go in terms of web design I think I have at least produced a better product than my other attempt. As this is a portfolio the plan is to routinely come back to it and slowly update it as I progress. 

# Technologies Used

-Adobe XD
I had been hearing about this program for a while and wanted to use it as I was already familiar with other Adobe products and I think it is a great way to layout your site if you have access to it. An image of my initial design layout can be seen below.

And then the final running application can be seen here.
